apt  -->    Advanced Packaging Tool

APT is a package manager primarily used in Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Debian.

APT has a vast repository of software packages and supports dependency resolution, ensuring that all required packages are installed for a given application to work correctly.
