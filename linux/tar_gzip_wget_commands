tar  ---> this command is used to compress and archive files that can be moved from one disk of machine to other.

-c -> this creates archive
-x -> this extracts archive
-t -> displays contents of archive
-z -> to compress the archive
-f -> allows to specify file name of archive

This command works recursively.
The order of options while using tar command should follow orderly.

tar -czvf <give new file name with extension .tar.gz> <location of dir of which it is archived>
Example: tar -czvf etc.tar.gz /etc
If need to archive in tmp location,
tar -czvf /tmp/etc.tar.gz /etc/


To use bz or bzip instead of gz or gzip, use j option instaed of z
tar -cjvf <give new file name with extension .tar.bz2> <location of dir of which it is archived, can give multiple paths of dir to archieve multiple dir.>

To exclude files/directories from archive, 
tar --exclude=<give file/dir names to exclude> -czvf <name of archive with extension .tar.gz or .tar.bz2> <name of dir> -> for one file/dir

tar  --exclude=<give file/dir name1> --exclude=<give file/dir name2> --exclude=<give file/dir name3> â€¦. -czvf <name of archive with extension .tar.gz or .tar.bz2> <name of dir where it should be unarchived> -> for more than one file


To extract archive,
tar -xzvf <name of archive> <location where needs to be extracted>


To extract archive in other directory, use -C
tar -xzvf <name of archive> -C < location where needs to be extracted>


To archive dir/file with date,
tar -czvf <name of archive, etc-$(date +%F).tar.gz> <name of dir which is to be archived>
